86.2,"April, 2020","Problem Definition

Despite having one of the best conditions for rice growing, the Myanmar rice sector has one of the lowest yields by global standards. This is because the Myanmar rice sector is highly fragmented, made up of smallholder farmers who grow their crops independently of each other and do not achieve economies of scale. This is further perpetuated by poor farming methods and high intermediary costs, trapping whole farming communities in a poverty cycle. 
Value Proposition

Golden Sunland collaborates with Myanmar smallholder farmers as an aggregator, to steward and streamline the value chain, from seed, to harvest, to table. 
Progressive Solution

Their collaboration is an inclusive model that improves yields, lowers costs and is sustainable. This improves the lives of their partner farmers and alleviates poverty within their communities. They extend the farmers’ reach by exporting and distributing the farmers' produce beyond Myanmar borders under “The Little Rice Company” brand.

With each step to improve performance and environmental efficiency, Harrogate Water seeks to give something back. This ethos was behind the launch of Thirsty Planet water.

To reliably contribute to the deeper understanding and improvement of the world, data science tools must be sustainable over the long haul, which requires a stable, long-term source of financial investment. Today, millions of people download and use RStudio open-source products in their daily lives while thousands of organizations and individuals, who have the need and ability to pay for their commercial products on premises or online, help them to sustain this work. Together, these products form a virtuous cycle. The adoption of open-source data science software in organizations creates demand for our commercial products, which enable teams to adopt open-source data science software at scale.

Environmentally & socially committed from day one, Picture was founded by 3 friends in 2008 with a baseline that every product developed must have a minimum of 50% organic, recycled or bio-based materials. Venturing off the beaten path by using materials and processes to reduce their impact was the starting point for their commitment to the environment.

Since then, they have always sought to make responsible purchasing affordable : an eco-designed & fair snow jacket should cost the consumer the same amount as a regular jacket. 
Today, their commitment goes beyond products and involves every aspect of their business.

Wiping out the use of fossil fuels throughout the company and bringing all of their partners, friends, and competitors on board and into the fight is now their number one priority. This involves every aspect of their company.
Through the power of communications, it is also their role to move people, to inspire change, to shine the spotlight on the world’s current environmental issues, and to present viable solutions.

83.6,"October, 2019","They are the transport company that reinvented mobility in Benin by providing safe and reliable transportation services in an ecosystem where mobility is a matter of luck. Through their leadership they want to show that there is another way to do business, by being inclusive and sustainable in everything they do. Their special focus is on isolated and underserved communities.
They take pride in their amazing local team of over 250 people. In less than 6 years they have managed to grow and become the largest bus company in Benin. While entrepreneurship is underdeveloped in risk averse cultures, they showed that it can be an opportunity for growth. 
In 2013 they began by servicing a few lines, and now they are the largest bus company and the only one with national coverage. 
They choose to not only serve lines with the most profit potential, but also to ensure that there are lines connecting communities where these services are scarce. And this has become their competitive advantage: they have learned to run efficient and profitable service on lines that are economically less attractive by embedding them in an effective national network.
To do so, Baobab operates a fleet of 24 comfortable buses, connecting all destinations across Benin.

In collaboration with multiple work facilities for disabled people, their products are packed in The Netherlands, where people with poor job prospects play a vital role in the production process.
As 21-year old students, Jasper and Melvin – the founders of Seepje – watched a documentary in which a Nepalese woman used a natural form of soap. ‘Why do we use synthetic and oil-based products, when a natural alternative is available?’, they thought.

This business is only two people and a passenger van, specializing in small group tours of the Petoskey Wine Region--a beautiful area in northwest Michigan that produces award-winning wines from unique, cold-climate grapes.
Owners Kassia Perpich and Jeff Kozisek could have designed Vine Ride as “just another shuttle service” and called it a day, but they chose to think deeply and creatively about their business impact. By offering wine tours, they aspire to connect wine enthusiasts to each other and to the unique flavors of the Petoskey Wine Region; to reduce traffic, carbon emissions and impaired driving in their community; to preserve small-scale family farming as a viable economic and land conservation strategy; and of course, to show people a good time!
Vine Ride also makes conscientious choices behind the scenes. It purchases most of its wine tour supplies from locally- and/or women-owned businesses, offsets the van's carbon emissions with clean energy investments, recycles and composts most of its waste, and shares its time and treasure with many local charities.

We unlock the most amazing, productive group of talent: part-time professionals. We also provide businesses with the tools to get flexible, increase employee wellbeing and prepare for the future of work.
Why Beam: Co-Founders Stephanie Reuss and Victoria Stuart left corporate careers to start Beam because they wanted to change the conversation around part-time. It was personal. When they became mums, because of big careers, they were forced to burn out or drop out of the workforce altogether. The obvious middle ground — part-time — wasn't an option because most businesses weren't doing it well or at all. 
The brain drain of amazing women at this stage of life is crazy and has enormous implications for women in leadership roles, superannuation, wellbeing and more. But Beam isn't just about mums. Lots of people can't work full-time even though they're still ambitious and super productive — parents, carers, athletes, those with portfolio careers, people starting businesses…

Roger’s solution for ending poverty for smallholders is to provide them with modern equipment, which not only ends daily drudgery but also improves crops. For every 10% rise in crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa, poverty drops 7%. 
CoolCap has created a simple, scalable way to make this possible. They identify high-potential farmers through wholesale buyers, they only sell equipment that pays for itself through its use, and they offer a simple pay-as-you-go approach that makes sense.

Coming straight from the Caucasus Mountains, the region between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, it recalls times where sharing was the way of life.
A thousand years separate the history of the kefir birth from the discovery of the drink by Julia and Raphael. It was living on the campus of the University of Chicago that the couple had first contact with the probiotic drink. Rafael was a Master in Finance and Julia worked at the University. There they fell in love with the drink.
Back in Brazil, they could not find the drink ready for consumption anywhere. In a healthy nostalgia and in the search to promote and spread more and more health, they thought aloud: ""What if we could keep this millenary tradition in line with current times?""
Thus, Keiff is born. It was years of research, contact with several local producers and many, many tests until the birth of the first ""Keiffs"".

The ecosystem of tools integrates all aspects of the classroom, from gamified personalized learning to formative assessment and classroom management. The game mechanics encourage students help one another, stay on task, and take an active stance against bullying. This creates a more fun, empathetic classroom culture where students are deeply engaged.
Systemically, Classcraft addresses engagement by connecting real-life interventions with engagement data from existing content and platforms. The result is a positive impact on individuals and educational outcomes including school climate, social emotional learning, academic performance, and attendance.

They use an innovative structure to do something no one has ever done before: Offer expert, high-quality legal advice to any American with a serious need — for free. Their initial focus is on navigation: They diagnose clients’ needs, explain their options, and help them find and hire the right specific lawyer (or nonprofit) to move forward. To lawyers, they operate as a broker: They send them pre-vetted clients, and earn a percentage of what they make from each successful representation.
Who are their clients? A sample to date: A woman harassed for refusing her boss’s advances. A child whose parent died without a will. A father disabled after being hit by a truck. An immigrant seeking to grow her family. Some of these folks are rural and low-income; others are wealthy and well-educated.
